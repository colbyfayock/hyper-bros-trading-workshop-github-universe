# ðŸ““ Lesson 02: Create a new GitHub repository and link local project

[GitHub](https://github.com/) (where you might be looking at this from) is a web platform that gives developers the ability to utilize version control system Git in a more "social" and collaborative way. On top of that, it has loads of other features like my favorite [Actions](https://www.youtube.com/colbz/search?query=github%20actions) and even [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)!

As developers, it's probably one of the most foundational tools we can learn, as Git (and GitHub) make working with teams a much better experience.

## Getting Started

For this workshop, we'll ultimately be deploying our application to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and while there are a variety of ways we can do that, we're going to take advantage of Netlify's ability to integrate with a GitHub repository to automate building and deploying the project any time changes are pushed.

So in this lesson, we'll use GitHub to create a new repository, learn how to set up our new project with that repository, and push out our code so that it's hosted and version controlled on GitHUb.

## Objectives
* Create a new GitHub repository
* Connect a local repository to GitHub


## Exercises

### 1. Creating a new GitHub repository

Creating a new repository only really requires one thing â€” a name! But we also have a few other options such as if we want that repository to be public or private.

When creating the repository, we have the option to do so with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), but we can also use the GitHub web UI which is what we'll follow along with here.

#### Goal

Use your GitHub account to create a new empty repository.

#### Resources
* [Creating a new repository - GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)

### 2. Configure local project to push code to Github repository

Once we have a new repository, we need to ultimately put some code in it!

While sometimes starting from scratch is an option, we already have some code, but its currently located on our local environment.

#### Goal

Connect your new local project to your new GitHub repository.

#### Resources
* [Adding an existing project to GitHub using the command line](https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line)

## Extra Credit

### 1. Update the project's README with information about your store

When we creating a new project in Lesson 1, it came with an existing README.md file that includes some basic information about the project.

If you notice on your GitHub repository's main page, GitHub uses that README to show information about the project.

This works great, but we want to make sure the README is accurate for OUR project, not someone else's.

Note: this could be as simple as updating the title or adding some more information about your goal for the project!

#### Goal

Update the README with information about your online store and push the changes to the GitHub repository.

#### Where We'll Make Changes
* `README.md`

### 2. Update the project's package.json with your project info

Similar to the README.md file, the project came with a package.json which is what node uses to manage project dependencies.

On top of that, the file includes some metadata about the project, including a name and author information.

Note: package.json is sensitive and it's required to be a valid JSON document. When making changes, be sure to avoid syntax errors!

#### Goal

Update package.json with your project and author information 

#### Where We'll Make Changes
* `package.json`
