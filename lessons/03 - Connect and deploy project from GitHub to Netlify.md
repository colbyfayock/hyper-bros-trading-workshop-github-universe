# ðŸ““ Lesson 03: Connect and deploy project from GitHub to Netlify

As we mentioned in Lesson 2, we'll be using [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) to actually deploy our application. This will give us a way to easily get our project built, deployed, and available for anyone in the world to see.

On top of that, it has a ton of other great features that make collaborative work great such as deploy previews, where if you create a Pull Request, Netlify by default will automatically create a new deployment with those changes! While we're only going to gover the main deployment flow, there's a lot more you can get into with this tool.

## Getting Started

In this lessson, our overall goal is to deploy our application to the world!

Because we already have our application set up in a GitHub repository, Netlify makes this easy to connect where any new changes we push our automatically get deployed.

## Objectives
* Connect a GitHub repository to Netlify
* Create a new Netlify site
* Deploy a Netlify site
* Review Next.js on Netlify
* Cutomzing the Netlify Site subdomain


## Exercises

### 1. Connecting the GitHub repository to Netlify

With our GitHub repository ready to go, we're all set to get started with Netlify.

Using your Netlify account, we'll create a new Netlify Site where we'll use GitHub's oAuth integration to authenticate and give Netlify access to our project repository.

#### Goal

Connect our new GitHub repository to a new Netlify site

### 2. Setting up a custom Netlify subdomain

When creating a new Netlify site, Netlify uses a unique, randomly generated string so that the project can be available on the web without conflicting with someone else's project.

But we don't have to live with that subdomain, we can customize it to be whatever we want! (As long as it's unique).

#### Where We'll Make Changes
* Netlify > Site Settings > Domain Management > Custom Domains

#### Goal

Customize the Netlify site subdomain to your store's name

## Extra Credit

### 1. Push some new changes to test auto-deploy

Netlify has a ton of great features that take the pain out of the DevOps side of things including auto-deploying Pull Requests to preview new changes!

Unless turned off, this is configured by default, meaning all you need to do is create a new Pull Request with some changes to test this out.

#### Where We'll Make Changes
* New branch with a new Pull Request

Tip: Try changing the store's name to something goofy on a new branch, pushing that out to GitHub, and creating a Pull Request with it!
