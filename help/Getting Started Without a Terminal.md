# Getting Started Without a Terminal

While I highly encourage you to use a terminal to work through this project, it's understandable that not everyone may have the experience or ability to use one.

The good news is we can still get productive right inside of the brower and work through most of the lessons, though it will just be a little bit more challenging. 

Here's what you likely _won't_ be able to do if you continue outside of the terminal:
- See the changes live in a local environment
- Install dependencies to the project using npm
- Add local environment variables

## Creating a New Project

The workshop starter is configured to use a GitHub feature called templates which allows you to easily clone a repository with a clean Git start.

To use this feature, head over to [colbyfayock/hyper-bros-trading-workshop-starter](https://github.com/colbyfayock/hyper-bros-trading-workshop-starter) where at the top of the page, you should see a green button that says **Use this template**.

Once clicked, GitHub will present you with the option of creating a new repository on your account where you can choose the name that you'd like.

## Working with Code

GitHub includes an on-page code editor where you can make changes to your project. While you won't get all of the features you may with a tool like VS Code, you'll at least have the ability to make changes.

## Deploying Code

Given the tools we'll use to deploy the code (Netlify) integrates directly with GitHub, you'll be able to deploy your code just like you would if running the code locally.

That also means, while you won't have a local environment, any time you make changes Netlify will automatically redeploy, so you'll have the ability to see the new changes after a few minutes.

## FAQ

### Can I use CodeSandbox to work on the project?

Yes! I think. I haven't used t he feature before but you can link a project in CodeSanxbox meaning you should be able to make commits directly from the cloud based IDE. The means you should be able to use it to install dependencies and work with a typical local environment.
